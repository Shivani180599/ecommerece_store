Django 
***********************

Create enviornment 
py -m venv venv

activate enviornment 
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install Django

After installing startproject 

>django-admin startproject core .
py manage.py startapp store

inside store there we need to create model 

inside model.py we create model category  of the website(refer model.py file)

inside core settings.py 'store' (add store refere core settings.py file )

then run these two cmd

py manage.py makemigrations
py manage.py migrate

(this will migrate both two class of model.py category and product and will create 0001_initial.py)

Now add media folder in the venv
and add urls (refer urls.py pf core)
also add those refernce of urls inside core settings
(this will help to add urls of the media)


Now can create admin of the our django website

for that inside store admin.py have to add both models(refer admin.py file)

Now we can run server 
cmd id :-
py manage.py runserver

by running tis we have to give username and password for accessing as an admin 

once its accessable we can add category of the store and the product
*************************************************
Now the next step is two add template to so user can access

create urls.py inside store (refer urls.py)
now that urls need to add with the veiw of the store(check view.py)
also in core urls.py include store.urls(refer urls.py)

create template folder inside that add store and inside it create home.html page

that tamplate need to be added in the core settings.py
also store/home.html path need to be added inside store view.py

now if we runserver will be able to see home page
